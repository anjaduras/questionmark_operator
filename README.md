# Illustrating the Usage of the Question Mark Operator in JavaScript

The provided code snippet demonstrates the usage of the question mark operator (`?.`) in JavaScript. The question mark operator is used to perform optional chaining, allowing for safe navigation through nested object properties or method calls that might be undefined or null.

In the code example, an object `user` is defined, representing a user's information. It includes properties such as `name`, `age`, `email`, and `address`. However, the `city` property within the `address` object is commented out, intentionally left undefined.

The `displayUserInfo` function showcases the question mark operator and its benefits. Here's a breakdown of the relevant parts:

- Ternary Operator for Age Calculation:
  - The user's age is determined using a ternary operator: `const age = user.age > 18 ? "Adult" : "Minor";`.
  - If the user's age is greater than 18, it is considered an "Adult," otherwise a "Minor."

- Optional Chaining to Access City:
  - The line `console.log(user.address?.city);` demonstrates the usage of optional chaining (`?.`).
  - Optional chaining allows safe access to the `city` property of the `address` object, even if it is undefined or null.
  - In this case, since `user.address?.city` is undefined, the console log will output `undefined`.

- Nullish Coalescing Operator for Default Value:
  - The line `const city = user.address?.city ?? "Unknown";` combines optional chaining with the nullish coalescing operator (`??`).
  - The nullish coalescing operator assigns the value of `user.address?.city` to `city`.
  - If `user.address?.city` is null or undefined, the nullish coalescing operator sets `city` to the default value of "Unknown".

- Error Handling:
  - To demonstrate error handling, an `if` statement checks if `user.address?.city` is falsy (null or undefined).
  - If it is falsy, an error is thrown using `throw new Error("City is not specified");`.
  - This showcases how optional chaining can help prevent errors when accessing nested properties.

The component renders the user information in a `<div>` container, displaying the user's name, age, email, and city. The city value is displayed using the nullish coalescing operator, ensuring a default value of "Unknown" if it is not specified.

By utilizing the question mark operator and its associated features, the code demonstrates a safer and more concise way to handle potentially undefined or null values within objects.
